            <p>Jarret Thompson is a college student who is earning a major degree in electrical engineering. He has a variety of interests and passions that he keeps up with. Unlike many youths, he is an avid participant in politicking: in high school he served as class president, and as an adult and college student he remains aware of larger political issues and the state of education as a whole. His views are pragmatic, forgoing any tendency to take a side and instead investigating topics and following evidence to whatever conclusion it may lead. He does not take his politicking to seriously, however; he is happy to engage in political humor with anyone to make them laugh.</p>
            <p>Electrical engineering is his major of choice largely because of the intrigue he feels whenever he is working on electrical systems. When asked about his thoughts on it, he recalled one of his early "experiments" involving a used thermostat that his dad brought home from work. He spent time taking the device apart and studying its internal components. His interest grew from that to presently studying Calculus (may he have our blessing for such a brave endeavor).</p>

            <p>Beyond his college studies and football history, Jarret has an engaging character and is memorable for how carefree he can be. He's quite straightforward with problem solving and will not hesitate to go for a solution that comes to mind. He's just as straightforward with social interactions: if you were to meet him, the first two things he'd like you to know are: that he is outspoken and not to take his open-minded sense of humor to heart because he means it harmlessly; and that he is respectful and quiet when he needs to be.</p>
            <p>Jarret shares our interest in programming to a degree as well. He has completed a course on C++, which is a high-level language in the same family as C# and Java. When asked about whether that course changed the way he views programming, his response was: <blockquote>"Oh, absolutely. I had no idea about programming before then. Now I know just how much goes into programming. I had to make an addition program that let the user enter a number, then add values starting from 1 up to that number and give a total. I had to do it without a for loop and it was really frustrating to figure it out because we hadn't been taught how to do it without a for loop yet. It was hard."</blockquote></p>
            <p>When it comes to technology, Jarret is a user of the macOS and iOS ecosystem. He prefers iPhone over Android for several reasons. The primary reason is that iPhone is just the platform he's always used. He also likes the aesthetics of the iPhone and the fact that everything he needs is located right on the home screen. He also feels that the simplicity of the iPhone is better than with Android.</p>
