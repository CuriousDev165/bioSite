            <h1 id="page-header">About Jarret</h1>
            <p>Jarret Thompson is a college student who is earning a major degree in electrical engineering. He has a variety of interests and passions that he keeps up with. Unlike many youths, he is an avid participant in politicking: in high school he served as class president, and as an adult and college student he remains aware of larger political issues and the state of education as a whole. His views are pragmatic, forgoing any tendency to take a side and instead investigating topics and following evidence to whatever conclusion it may lead. He does not take his politicking to seriously, however; he is happy to engage in political humor with anyone to make them laugh.</p>
            <p>Electrical engineering is his major of choice largely because of the intrigue he feels whenever he is working on electrical systems. When asked about his thoughts on it, he recalled one of his early "experiments" involving a used thermostat that his dad brought home from work. He spent time taking the device apart and studying its internal components. His interest grew from that to presently studying Calculus (may he have our blessing for such a brave endeavor).</p>
