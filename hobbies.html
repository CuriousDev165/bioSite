            <p>Jarret could likely tell you the state of any given team in the National Football League. He remains quite aware of each team's performance throughout the season. His favorite team, for those who wonder, is the Dallas Cowboys (which is no surprise for a Texas-born man).His love of the game is more than just fandom, though. Jarret thinks some casual viewers or non-participants may not understand how deeply invovled the game can be. He sees more than the action: he can see the play design, what job each player has in a play, and which plays might work best in a given scenario. He even professes that he could predict the playmaking in some of his high-school's football games!</p>

            <p>Jarret has been a consistent lifter for approximately 5 years. His training started with high-school football and continues through his adulthood whenever he gets time between work and school. His knowledge of workouts and movements is fairly extensive, ranging from different types of deadlifts to the ideal routine for different goals (i.e., endurance vs strength). His number one advice for those who are interested in or new to weightlifing is to: (1) start slow and build yourself up, and (2) choose lifting form over the amount of weight moved any day of the week.</p>
